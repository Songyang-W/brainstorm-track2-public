# User Persona

User personas create the bridge between raw data and empathetic, functional design. Without them, designers often fall into the trap of "Self-Referential Design," where they subconsciously build a product for themselves rather than the actual end-user.

## The Clinical Operator

**Name**: Kat  
**Age**: 28  
**Specialty**: Neural Interface Engineer / Clinical Specialist

### Background

A PhD in Neuroscience with a decade of experience in electrophysiology. Kat has been in over 200 surgeries and acts as the technical "pilot" during the implantation of BCI arrays.

### Role in Surgery

Responsible for real-time signal analysis. Kat interprets the neural data to tell the surgeon exactly where the motor cortex is firing, ensuring the array is placed over the optimal "hand-knob" area of the brain.

### Communication Style

Precise, verbal, and authoritative. Must translate complex data visualizations into actionable anatomical directions for the neurosurgeon (e.g., "Shift 3mm medial to avoid the cortical vein").

### Tech Literacy

**Expert.** Kat understands raw signal processing, impedance testing, and the specific hardware constraints of the system. They expect a UI that prioritizes raw data fidelity over aesthetics.

### Surgical Goal

To place the array over the optimal region of the brain. Kat wants to see stable signal quality across all electrode channels before the surgeon finishes the surgery.

### UX Challenge

**Environment saturation.** In a crowded OR, Kat needs to see the screen from 6 feet away. Overly dense UI or "hidden" menus are a safety risk; they need a "heads-up display" style of hierarchy where critical alerts (like signal loss) are impossible to miss.
